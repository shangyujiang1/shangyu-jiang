â€‹Since I am a tutor, I am often asked about what are some good colleges and universities to apply to. I have compiled a list based on my personal experience as a tutor. Stanford University Harvard University University of California, Los Angeles Columbia Law School Cornell Law School Duke University School of Law Georgetown University Law Center Harvard Law School New York University School of Law Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law The Wharton School Stanford Graduate School of Business Booth School of Business Harvard Business School MIT Sloan School of Management Columbia Business School Haas School of Business Kellogg School of Management Yale School of Management Stanford Law School University of California, Berkeley School of Law University of Chicago Law School University of Michigan Law School University of Pennsylvania Law School University of Virginia School of Law Yale Law School Massachusetts Institute of Technology New York University Princeton University Columbia University Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons Harvard Medical School Geisel School of Medicine (Dartmouth College) Yale School of Medicine Warren Alpert Medical School (Brown University) Weill Cornell Medicine (Cornell University) Yale University University of Michigan University of California, Berkeley
